# Modern PM Modstores
An online repository of community made mods for Paper Mario Sticker Star, Color Splash, The Origami King, and The Thousand Year Door Switch. Utilizes services created and maintained by [Universal Updater](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Updater) and [Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore)

# Installation

#3DS
- You will need to install [Universal-Updater](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Updater). 
- Download Paper-Mario-3DS.unistore and Paper-Mario-3DS.t3x from the PM4 source folder and place them in sdmc:/3ds/Universal-Updater/stores on your SD card.
- In Universal Updater, open the settings tab, then go to Select Unistore and select Paper-Mario-3DS-Unistore.
- From here, you can select the mod(s) you would like to install, and follow the on screen prompts.

#Wii U
- You Will Need [SDCafiine](https://github.com/wiiu-env/sdcafiine_plugin) and the [Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore) 
- Download wiiu_KEEPMAINAPPSTORE.zip OR wiiu_MODSTOREONLY.zip from the PM5 source folder and extract it to your SD card. The wiiu_MODSTOREONLY.zip contains a new BGM.
- Currently, the json also contains the repo for the HB App Store, so mods will show alongside homebrew apps. To help make it easier to find mods, they will be located in the Games section.
- Open the HB App Store, and browse the games section. Follow the instructions for each mod as some may be standalone modpacks, or merge into a general folder

#Switch
- You Will Need [Atmosphere](https://github.com/atmosphere-nx/atmosphere/releases) and the [Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore) 
- Download switch_KEEPMAINAPPSTORE.zip OR switch_MODSTOREONLY.zip from the PM62R source folder and extract it to your SD card. The switch_MODSTOREONLY.zip contains a new BGM. (BGM Does Not Play In Applet Mode)
- Currently, the json also contains the repo for the HB App Store, so mods will show alongside homebrew apps. To help make it easier to find mods, they will be located in the Games section.
- Atmosphere's layered FS does not use a standard modloader, meaning all mods will use the same folder. BE ADVISED THAT SOME MODS MAY CLASH WITH OTHERS SO PLEASE READ THEIR DESCRIPTIONS
